					<h2>So...what is this?</h2>
					<p class="subsection">
						I've traveled to many places across the U.S. On this page, you'll find a small sampling of them.

						<h3>Orlando, FL</h3>
						<p>
							My first-ever vacation! At least, that I remember. 
						</p>
						<p>
							My family took me down here to visit Walt Disney World and see a few sights. It was a long drive, and you should have seen my face when we finally drove under through the gates of the Kingdom!
						</p>

						<h3>St. Louis, MO</h3>
						<p>
							Since it's relatively nearby, this city has been the site of several small trips by me, my friends, and family. There's plenty of great things to do and see here, from the Arch to Forest Park to the Delmar Loop to the Hill.
						</p>
						<p>
							My personal favorite spot here is the <a href="http://www.citymuseum.org/"> City Museum</a>, a surreal, mazelike, completely interactive wonderland that truly must be seen to be believed.

						<h3>Chattanooga, TN</h3>
						<p>
							This river city sits near the base of Lookout Mountain, which boasts some great sightseeing opportunities. The area boasts high spots like Rock City (seen above), as well as several Civil War battlefields.
						</p>
						<p>
							My personal favorite spot in the area has to be Ruby Falls, a sprawling cavern that hides an underground waterfall.

						<h3>Western South Dakota</h3>
						<p>
							I could barely pick one part of this trip that didn't interest me! There's the Black Hills, Mt. Rushmore, the Badlands, Custer State Park, the Needles Highway, and much, much more.
						</p>
						<p>
							It took a long time to get here, but it was well worth the drive.

						<h3>New Orleans, LA</h3>
						<p>
							Welcome to the Big Easy! I found this place so interesting that I'm planning on visiting again later this year.
						</p>
						<p>
							While the city isn't without its problems, it's a place rich in culture and history, and is definitely worth visiting. In NOLA, you can admire the distinctive architecture of the French Quarter and the Garden District, visit one of the various museums, enjoy a local band at Frenchmen Street, and eat some great food just about anywhere in the city.

						<h3>Destin, FL</h3>
						<p>
							A town located on an absolutely beautiful section of the gulf coast. My family visited here twice for about three or four days each time, and we almost didn't want to leave.
						</p>
						<p>
							The highlight of the trip for me was seeing the ocean (and getting to swim in it) for the first time since I was too young to remember. And not to mention, the seafood here is great; after all, Destin got its start as a fishing town.
